    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    let age = 100;
    let age2 = age;
    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.


    const team = players;
    console.log(players, team);

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = 'lux';
    // however what happens when we update that array?
        // it updates the both arrays with lux. pritty weird.
    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    const team2 = players.slice();
    // the slice makes a copy. pritty cool and wont update the players array/

    // one day

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    const team3 = [].concat(players);
    // the above  is weird but sure i will roll with it.


    // or use the new ES6 Spread

    const team4 = [...players];
    team4[3] = 'hehehe';

    console.log(team4);

    const team5 = Array.from(players);
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
      // origanal is not changed.
    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects

    //the same thing happens with objects.

    const person = {
        name : 'joe',
        age : 22
    }

    // and think we make a copy:
    // this is only a reference so will change the orignal object.
    const captain = person;
    captain.number = 99;

    // how do we take a copy instead?

    Object.assign({}, person, { number:99});
    console.log(cap2);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
